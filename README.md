## 11Secrets.com Visual News Aggregator
### By Soroush Pour and Fabio Berger

This is the source code for 11Secrets.com, a visual news aggregator for fashion and gossip news. Design and RSS Feeds can be customized. Articles formatted and pulled into DB using FullText RSS-to-JSON API.

Built using CodeIgniter framework with InnoDB MySQL DB.

Some configuration files removed to hide private passwords and keys, but all other files are here for the open source community to use.

Don't forget to add your own AWS public and private keys in application/controllers/s3transfer.php where the placeholders AWS_PUBLIC_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY have been placed.
